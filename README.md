# server-test
A small script containing a server in Node.JS with Express third-party-library to test the configurations on the cloud servers and more. For now, we don't have any database set. The main proporse is to check if the API answer the requests properly.

The server runs on port 5000 and the endpoint to check if it's running properly is "/server/running"
